## Linear Regression with One Variable

##### 1

Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well they did in their first year. Specifically, let x be equal to the number of "A" grades (including A-. A and A+ grades) that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). We would like to predict the value of y, which we define as the number of "A" grades they get in their second year (sophomore year).

Questions 1 through 4 will use the following training set of a small sample of different students' performances. Here each row is one training example. Recall that in linear regression, our hypothesis is $hθ(x)=θ_0+θ_1x$, and we use m to denote the number of training examples.

**For the training set given above, what is the value of** m? **In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).**



Answer: 4

Many substances that can burn (such as gasoline and alcohol) have a chemical structure based on carbon atoms; for this reason they are called hydrocarbons. A chemist wants to understand how the number of carbon atoms in a molecule affects how much energy is released when that molecule combusts (meaning that it is burned). The chemist obtains the dataset below. In the column on the right, “kJ/mol” is the unit measuring the amount of energy released.

You would like to use linear regression (hθ(x)=θ_0+θ_1x) to estimate the amount of energy released (y) as a function of the number of carbon atoms (x). Which of the following do you think will be the values you obtain for θ_0 and θ_1? You should be able to select the right answer without actually implementing linear regression.



Answer:θ_0=−569.6, θ_1=−530.9

Suppose we set $\theta_0$ = 0, $\theta_1$ = 1.5  in the linear regression hypothesis from Q1. What is$h_{\theta}(2)$?

Answer: 3

Explaination: $hθ(x)=θ_0+θ_1x$ = 0+1.5*2 = 3
